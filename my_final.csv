"0,""It has been over a year since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. The past year has seen more than 145 million infections. While the recovery rate has been a good 85%, more than 3 million fatalities have been registered. Governments across the world responded to the pandemic first with global travel advisories, suspension of visas and international flights, prohibition against mass gatherings, cancellation of sporting and cultural events, and then with closure of offices and educational institutions, halting of inter-state transport, railways, and other measures to enforce lockdowns in their respective nations. The restrictions were gradually lifted within a regulated environment. Actions taken by governments differed basis their infrastructural preparedness, number of testing done, reported number of cases and political consensus, but they all followed a basic minimum approach with regard to social distancing, hygiene and call for wearing a mask. The pandemic and the consequent lockdowns had an immediate impact on most industries and sectors, leading to a steep decline in the gross domestic product (GDP) of most countries. Several industries had to re-invent their operating model and distribution system to adapt to innovative ways of working. Several organisations have looked inwardly at their supply chains and other processes and, wherever possible, directed employees to work from home for reasons of safety and health. Many organisations have restricted travel, conferences, events and embarked on cost reduction and austerity measures to protect their own cashflows and profitability. The pandemic severely impacted travel and tourism globally, causing the industry a loss of almost US$ 4.5 trillion. Domestic visitor spends decreased by 45% while international visitor spends decreased by 69.4% compared to 2019 (Source: World Travel & Tourism Council, Economic Impact Reports 2020). With very little option, the hospitality industry explored ways to survive this period by exploring new revenue opportunities and optimising costs. A fallout of this has been the loss of 61.6 million jobs globally, and there is threat of higher losses if government retention schemes are withdrawn before the industry revives. However, this did not prevent the industry from supporting the medical fraternity and governments in every possible way during the pandemic. Also, service provided to guests continued despite the challenges in full compliance with the regulations and by ensuring the highest health and safety standards. New mutations of the virus have given rise to another COVID-19 wave in the fourth quarter of the year, affecting India, the United States of America (US), Brazil, Turkey and France amongst other countries. While reported cases are spiralling, the vaccines can reduce the severity and frequency of infections. There is a strong hope that an accelerated vaccination rollout, along with adherence to safety and hygiene norms, will neutralise the spread of the virus and bring back normalcy. The experience of countries leading this path, such as Israel and the United Kingdom (UK), should provide direction to countries lagging in their vaccination programmes."",0.10914443346508562,Positive"
"1,""The Year in Review In consequence of the pandemic and efforts to contain it, the global economy contracted by 3.3% in 2020 as compared to a growth of 2.8% in 2019. Advanced economies contracted by 4.7% while emerging markets and developing economies contracted by 2.2%. The US economy contracted by 3.5% and that of the UK by 9.9% during the year. Emerging and developing Asian economies contacted by 1.0%. Within this group, the Indian economy contracted by 8.0% while the economies of Sri Lanka, Maldives, Malaysia, Bhutan and Nepal contracted by 3.6%, 32.2%, 5.6%, 0.8% and 1.9% respectively. China was the only large economy to register a 2.3% growth in 2020 (Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook, April 2021). Most developed and large economies responded to the pandemic by deploying measures to stimulate the economy through liquidity support, tax cuts and other regulatory changes. Economic output losses were particularly severe for countries that rely on tourism and commodity exports and for those with limited policy space to respond. The pandemic overshadowed all other major global events including the change in US administration, the UK’s deal with the EU post Brexit, extreme weather events and geo-political tensions closer home. The global economy is projected to grow at 6% in 2021, moderating to 4.4% in 2022. The US economy is projected to grow by 6.4% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022, while the UK is projected to grow by 5.3% in 2021 and 5.1% in 2022. The IMF projects a 12.5% growth rate for India in 2021 and 6.9% in 2022 while China is projected to grow by 8.4% in 2021 and 5.6% in 2022. Emerging and developing Asia is projected to grow by 8.6% in 2021 and 6% in 2022. In Sri Lanka, the economy is expected to grow by 4.0% in 2021 while the Maldives is expected to grow by 18.9%. (Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook, April 2021). In the US, the US$ 1.9 trillion economic package is expected to deliver a significant jump in employment and economic growth. As per the Bank of England, with the UK aggressively pushing its vaccination programme, the country’s economic growth could reach pre-pandemic levels comparatively quickly. In its March 2021 report, the World Bank has highlighted clear signs of an economic rebound for south Asia, with per-capita incomes expected to revert to their pre-COVID levels by 2022. However, it has also highlighted that Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Nepal, which are dependent on tourism, could take significantly longer to recover depending on the pace of vaccination, reduction in infections and removal of travel restrictions. All estimates are subject to an adverse impact of the recent wave of COVID-19 infections. In its January 2021 report, the World Bank had forecast global economic output to expand by 4% in 2021 and moderate to 3.8% in 2022. However, it expects recovery of global economic output to remain below pre-pandemic trends for a prolonged period. It attributes the slower growth to the massive debt levels that have been accumulated over the past decade and recent stimulus packages, which, while creating liquidity, cause inflationary pressures, thereby exposing the global economy to financial market stress. The World Bank highlighted that downside risks could increase if the spread of virus was not controlled or there was delay in vaccine procurement and distribution. This could lead to more severe and longer-lasting effects on potential output and financial stress following from high debt levels and weak growth. The bank stated that limiting the spread of the virus, providing relief for vulnerable populations, and overcoming vaccine-related challenges were the immediate priorities (Source: Global Economic Prospects-World Bank)."",0.06345238095238098,Positive"
"2,""Indian Economy: The Year in Review The nation-wide lockdown caused a sharp contraction of 23.9% in GDP during Q1 FY 2021, recovering to a 7.5% drop in Q2, together with improvement in all key economic indicators. Commencing from July 2020, the recovery has been V-shaped, as demonstrated by Quarter-on-Quarter GDP growth, a sustained resurgence in high frequency indicators such as power demand, E-way bills, GST collection, steel consumption, and so on. GST collections, in fact, reached pre-COVID monthly levels following unlocking of industrial and commercial activity. Imports contracted more sharply than exports and foreign exchange reserves were at levels covering 18 months of imports. Inflation, mainly driven by food prices, remained above 6% for much of the year. India’s GDP is estimated to contract by 7.7% in FY 2020-21, with a sharp 15.7% decline in first half of the year and a minor 0.1% fall in the second half. Government consumption, improving private consumption and net exports have cushioned the economy in the second half. If taken sector-wise, agriculture can be said to have performed better in comparison to industries, with a growth of 3.4% during FY 2020-21. Industry and services are estimated to contract by 9.6% and 8.8% respectively during FY 2020-21. Within industry, mining is estimated to contract by 12.4%, manufacturing by 9.4% and construction by 12.6%. The utilities sector has shown a sharp recovery and is set to register a growth of 2.7% in FY 2020-21. Within services, trade, hotels, transport and communication, which together constitute one-third of overall services, are estimated to contract by 21.4%. The Economic Survey projects India’s real GDP to grow by 11% in 2021-22, provided normalisation of economic activities continues and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gathers traction. If this is supplemented with a supply-side push from reforms, the easing of regulation, continued infrastructural investments, recovery of pent-up demand, increase in discretionary consumption, low-interest credit disbursement and adequate liquidity, the Economic Survey projects that the economy can overtake the pre-pandemic levels of FY 2019-20 in another two years (Source: Economic Survey 2020-21). However, these estimates are subject to any adverse impact caused by the recent wave of the pandemic."",0.05623809523809523,Positive"
"3,""Global Hospitality and Tourism Industry Global tourism suffered its worst-ever year in 2020, with international arrivals dropping by 74% according to the latest data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). International arrivals at destinations worldwide were a billion fewer in 2020 than in the previous year. This was due to an unprecedented fall in demand caused by the strict travel restrictions imposed by governments to curtail the spread of the pandemic. International tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) dropped by 87% in January 2021, amid new outbreaks and tighter travel restrictions following a decline of 85% in the quarter ended December 2020. In Asia[1]Pacific, the count dropped by 96% since the region continues to have the highest level of travel restrictions in place. Europe and Africa both saw a decline of 85% in arrivals, while the Middle East recorded a drop of 84%. International arrivals in the Americas decreased by 77% in January 2021. (Source: UNWTO, Barometer January 2021) Outlook Owing to a surge in COVID-19 cases and emergence of new variants, many countries have reintroduced stricter travel restrictions, mandatory testing, quarantines, and in some cases, border closures and domestic lockdowns. This has impacted the resumption of international travel. Further, the pace of vaccinations has been slower than expected and varies across countries. With 32% destinations worldwide with complete border closure in early February, 2021 and another 34% with partial closure, UNWTO expects international tourist arrivals to be down by 85% during January-March, 2021 over the same period in 2019, representing a loss of about 260 million international arrivals. Most experts do not see global travel returning to pre[1]pandemic levels before 2023. Amongst all regions, Asia-Pacific is likely to see the highest rebound of international tourism. UNWTO’s extended scenarios for 2021-2024 indicate that it could take 2 1/2-4 years for international tourism to return to 2019 levels. In one scenario projected by it, there could be a rebound in September 2021, with 22% increase in international arrivals. Another scenario sees a rebound in July 2021, with international arrivals increasing by 66% for 2021 compared to the historic lows of 2020. One optimistic scenario projects arrivals at 55% below the pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019. The scenarios consider several factors such as a gradual improvement of the epidemiological situation, continued rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, a significant improvement in traveller confidence and a major lifting of travel restrictions, particularly in Europe and the Americas. When tourism does restart, UNWTO’s panel of experts foresee growing demand for open-air and nature-based tourism activities, with domestic tourism and ‘slow travel’ experiences gaining increasing interest.

"4,""Foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) in India, as per statistics provided by the Ministry of Tourism, averages at more than 10 million a year. During CY 2020, FTAs numbered 2.68 million compared to 10.93 million in 2019. Of this, during AprilDecember, 2020, FTAs were only 0.21 million tourist arrivals compared to 7.75 million arrivals during the same period of the previous year, registering a drop of 97%. As per Horwath HTL Market Report: India Hotel Market Review 2020, during the calendar year, occupancy was 34.5% with occupancy during the pandemic period of March to December, 2020 at 27.8%. However, occupancies started improving from October 2020, averaging 38% for the period October-December, 2020. Leisure showed a positive revival in destinations such as Udaipur, Goa, Rajasthan, Agra, Mussoorie, Rishikesh, Coorg and Himachal, with city occupancies driven by staycations. Weddings were back, though curtailed in size, while business travel and corporate events were marginal. The 13 Indian destinations tracked by STR, a global hospitality data analytics firm, registered an occupancy of 49.6% in Q4 FY 2021 as against 56.1% in Q4 FY 2019-20, with a 39% decline in Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR). As shown in the chart below, during this period, Goa registered an occupancy of 70.1%, higher than 63.8% during the same period in the previous year. Kolkata and Chandigarh area registered occupancies near to their previous year levels. Among the cities with large room inventories, Delhi registered an occupancy of 57.3% while that for Mumbai was 52.3%. Occupancy for Gurugram, Chennai and Bengaluru was 46.3%, 48.8% and 39.2% respectively. Except for Goa, RevPARs at most destinations remained subdued due to excessive supply and limited demand"",0.04000564652738567,Positive"
"5,""With international arrivals dropping at an alarming rate due to travel restrictions and advisories from time to time, the demand for hospitality is expected to arise mainly from the domestic sector. Within this sector, business travel has remained subdued and is being undertaken only for essential purposes or return to hometowns. As restrictions on movement were relaxed, the industry saw pent-up demand emerging from a sudden urge to travel to leisure destinations, mostly resorts, wellness centres, eco-tourism destinations and homestays within drivable distances. Successive lockdowns, resulting in businesses moving to a digital, work-from-home concept, ensured that the usual business travel was drastically reduced. Some hospitality experts are of the opinion that in the long run, a significant number of companies with mature digital adoption could continue with the work-from-home approach or adopt a hybrid approach. This would require the hotel industry to recalibrate itself to adapt to this change. Given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in India and the US, it appears that the situation may not significantly improve for the hospitality sector in the next couple of quarters. Beyond that, the outlook of the industry will be closely tied to disciplined practices of people, ability of local health authorities to contain the virus within small pockets, control over new strains of the virus and production, distribution and administration of vaccines. Two things are certain. First, that guests’ preferences of accommodation and dining would steer towards reputed brands that embed hygiene and safety in their products and services. Second, the hospitality sector with its resilience will survive and adapt to the changing demands of hospitality in the years to come."",0.027192640692640695,Positive"
"6,""IHCL’s strategy – ‘Aspiration 2022’ – and its vision to become the most iconic and profitable hospitality company while providing world-class customer service and experience, served the Company well during the past three years. It has directed its efforts at re-imagining its brandscape and service portfolio, re-engineering margins, technology and people and re-structuring itself to simplify and scale. These have enabled the Company to grow its portfolio, diversify its market presence and sustain its goal of expanding margins by continuous improvement in performance while preserving the health of its balance sheet. IHCL has a portfolio of 221 hotels, including 165 operational hotels, of which more than 50 hotels were signed in the past two years and 17 hotels were opened during the same period. The strength of its brands is reflected in the chart showing the Company’s RevPAR, a key performance measure over the past 10 years in comparison with the market.

As the government begun easing the lockdown restrictions in June 2020, economic activity started reviving slowly. However, several state governments put in place strict guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) that differed across states due to differential impact of the virus. As a result, hospitality, fine dining and spas were amongst the last few businesses to reopen. The strategy of IHCL – R.E.S.E.T. 2020 – introduced early in the year, began paying rich dividends in such a challenging environment. In the third quarter of the year, the industry started witnessing green shoots of revival with domestic leisure tourism leading the way, even as international tourism remained stagnant due to cross-border travel restrictions. The onset of the festive season brought much?needed cheer as people started travelling again to beat the lockdown and the work?from?home blues, especially to motorable leisure destinations, indicating the first signs of a gradual recovery in the sector. However, the fourth quarter of the year saw demand tapering off with the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. First the US and then Europe reported new strains of the virus, followed by similar occurrences towards the last week of March 2021 in India.

Against the benchmarked covers of the previous year, the first quarter of the current year saw a drop in covers to 20%, which steadily rose during the subsequent quarters to end the year at 49%.
